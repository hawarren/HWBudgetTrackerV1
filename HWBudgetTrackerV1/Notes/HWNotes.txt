Relation to bug tracker

Household...(users on project/household)
FinancialAccounts Project 

Budget... ticket types   (food budget is like "feature request")
budgetItem  ...Ticket(household has budgets)
...TicketComments(budgetItems are entries on budget)
...TicketHistory? (each entry is the history of that account)
Category
Transaction


***Budgets are like tickettypes, but each household makes up their own budget categories
Budgets are adhoc, any item can be put into a budget adhoc. whether the budget and category are the same is coincidence.
